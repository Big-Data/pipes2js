# pipes2js

Compile Yahoo! Pipes to Javascript (Node.js)


## Design

This tool lets you import Yahoo! Pipes into a custom script written in javascript, which controls the execution logic of the workflow.

This has two advantages :

 * The resulting workflow can be executed on Amazon SimpleWorkflow (SWF)
 * The modules developed for this experiment can be used for other Amazon SWF projects
